# rahberapp-algoritham - Course Recommendation System

rahberapp-algoritham is a Swift code that recommends courses to users based on their interests and previous enrollments.

## Overview

The system utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and popularity-based recommendations to suggest courses to users.

## Data Structures

### Course
- id: Unique identifier for the course.
- title: Title of the course.
- topic: Topic or subject of the course.
- instructor: Instructor or author of the course.
- popularity: Popularity score of the course.

### User
- id: Unique identifier for the user.
- interests: List of topics or subjects the user is interested in.
- previousEnrollments: List of IDs of courses the user has previously enrolled in.

## Recommendation Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm consists of the following steps:

- Collaborative Filtering: Recommend popular courses based on similar users' enrollments.
- Content-Based Filtering: Recommend courses based on user interests.
- Popularity-Based Recommendations: Recommend popular courses overall.

## Usage

1. Define course and user data using the provided structures.
2. Call the recommendCourses(for:) function, passing the user for whom recommendations are to be made.
3. Retrieve the recommended courses and display them to the user.
 
 
```
// Example usage:
let currentUser = users[0]
let recommendedCourses = recommendCourses(for: currentUser)
print("Recommended courses for User \(currentUser.id):")
for course in recommendedCourses {
    print("- \(course.title)")
}
```
